# Practice and Application

Here are a number of recommendations for developers to keep their environments secure.

1. Use full-disk encryption on your computers, especially laptops.
2. Create and use SSH keys which are appropriate. (cf. https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/03/definitive-2019-guide-cryptographic-key-sizes-and-algorithm-recommendations)
3. If you are operating mobile, use a VPN to encrypt your traffic.
4. If you are using Windows, install Windows Defender and keep it updated.
5. Use passphrases on your SSH keys.
6. Never share your login with anyone. Always provide a login to them.
7. Use a different password for every service.
8. Use a password manager such as 1Password.
9. If you have no need for a secret or data, delete it immediately.
